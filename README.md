**Setting up a git Repo**

Starting with the exercises in this module, we're going to be writing JavaScript files and committing them to a new git repository to keep track of them all and to submit the work.
Creating a New Repo

We will be creating a single git repo for all of the exercises in this module. Every single file that we create in _Module 4_ should be committed to this repo and pushed to GitHub.

1. Create a new github repo and clone it.

   - Log into GitHub and create a new repository called lighthouse-js-fundamentals.
     Copy the SSH link provided to you by GitHub, then ssh into Vagrant and clone the repo you just created using the git clone command.

git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER_NAME/lighthouse-js-fundamentals.git

    * Now, cd into the new directory.

    * cd lighthouse-js-fundamentals

**Conclusion**

In this exercise, we setup a new git repo. This is where we'll be saving all our exercise files in this module. Every time a new file is created within this directory, we'll commit it to git and then push it to GitHub.

- Add the README.md file to the
- repository git add README.md
- Commit your changes git commit -m "Updated README.md added‚Äù
